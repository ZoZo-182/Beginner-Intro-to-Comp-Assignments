# Beginner-Intro-to-Comp-Assignments

(Cpp) This repository contains some of my previous short and simply lab assignments from an Intro to Comp Sci course. 
These were assignments from my very first class related to programming. This was also my first time offically coding.
Breif course description: Intro to Comp Sci I was my introduction to basic concepts of computer science, with emphasis on programming. 
Covered fundamental techniques for software design and implementation. These concepts were demonstrated in the programming language C++.

As a Computer Engineer, this course was very essential to my ciriculum not only because this course a prerequisite for 
multiple advanced courses I later took, but also because the course enables computer engineers to understand the basics of programming, 
including syntax, data structures, and algorithms, which are essential skills for the field.
